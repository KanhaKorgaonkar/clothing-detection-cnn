# clothing-detection-cnn
replicating a convolutional neural network that identifies and categorizes clothes from the MNIST database

based on [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/training-convolutional-neural-networks-to-categorize-clothing-with-pytorch-30b6d399f05f) tutorial by the brilliant Albert Lai, with a fix for the PyTorch output shape runtime error, code explanations and notes with simplified explanations of deep learning concepts, and a matplotlib output visualizer.
